Many times a random profile ends up gaining our attention, be it for a well-written README, or a specific repository we were looking for. Thinking about this problem, I developed (with the help of Rocketseat), an application that has as main functionality to favorite any GitHub user. After entering the desired user, the application will show some GitHub-specific data, such as: profile picture, number of public repositories and followers. With this, the profile will be saved and we can access it whenever we want.
